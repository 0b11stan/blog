\o/ Hi ! I'm Tristan Auvinet Pinaudeau.
`0b11stan` is my pseudo (it's just pronounced `tristan`, because `0b11 = 3`, you got it ?).

I'm currently pentester at Capgemini so the majority of my work focuses on auditing. However, my expertise in GNU/Linux systems and my past experience in DevSecOps allow me to assist some clients in hardening their Unix infrastructure. I also have the privilege of being part of the official [Aces Of Spades](https://www.capgemini.com/fr-fr/perspectives/publications/les-aces-of-spades-lequipe-de-capture-the-flag-de-capgemini/) team, which enables me to participate in a good number of CTFs every year.

Personally, my interests include computing, sports, concerts, and festivals (punk, metal, electro, etc.).

What follows is a history of my professional experiences. It's a kind of detailed resume. For the TL;DR version, download my actual [resume](https://github.com/0b11stan/resume/blob/main/resume.pdf).
